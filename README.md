EuroGlobalMap QGIS stylesheets
==============================

*This repo contains QGIS stylesheets (QML) for use with [EuroGlobalMap](http://www.eurogeographics.org/products-and-services/euroglobalmap) data in ESRI Shapefile format*

EuroGlobalMap is a 1:1 million scale topographic dataset covering 45 countries and territories in the European region.
It is now available as opendata.

##Background

EuroGeographics recently made EuroGlobalMap available as open data.
There aren't many stylesheets available for use with this data so I decided to make my own. 

##Info

These stylesheets have been designed to work at various scales. I would recommend using them between 1:200,000 and 1:5,000,000

They have been made to work with ESRI Shapefiles [available here](http://www.eurogeographics.org/form/topographic-data-eurogeographics).

To fill in the sea tint you will need to set your background colour to **R** 159 **G** 212 **B** 225.

I recommend this layer order:

##Credit

Thanks to the guys at [EuroGeographics](http://www.eurogeographics.org/) for providing the ESRI Shapefiles and making them available as open data.

You are free to use these stylesheets however you want :)
